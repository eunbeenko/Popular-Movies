# Popular-Movies

## Datasets are scraped from following three websites:

IMDb's 100 popular movies: https://www.imdb.com/chart/moviemeter?ref_=nv_mv_mpm

Netflix's first 50 popular movies: https://reelgood.com/movies/source/netflix?filter-sort=1

Netflix's second 50 popular movies:https://reelgood.com/movies/source/netflix?filter-sort=1&offset=50

Box-Office top 100 worldwide grosses of movies: https://www.boxofficemojo.com/alltime/world/


These days, people can easily find out the evaluation of movies from various “movie rating” websites. However, not all the movie rating websites has the same result. In order to find out similarities of movies in various movie websites, I chose IMDb, Netflix, and Box-office to analyze. All the websites rate movies into various way, and among those availabilities, I decided on analyzing top 100 movies that have been specified as “popular” in IMDb and Netflix, then find out how these relate to the top 100 worldwide grosses, which shows in Box-Office website. For the rank in the IMDb chart, which reflects the popularity, is determined by IMDb Users. However, for the rank of popular movies in Netflix, the website did not specify how the popularity is being ranked, instead it gives users to see the movies that is "sort by popular". I assume the popularity of movies in Netflix is based upon Netflix Users.
